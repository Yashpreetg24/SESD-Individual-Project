# Personal Diet Planner Web App

## Overview
The Personal Diet Planner Web App is a full-stack application designed to help a single user plan and track daily nutrition. The system calculates calorie and protein requirements based on the user’s personal details and fitness goals, tracks daily food intake, and provides food suggestions to help meet nutritional targets.

## Problem Statement
Many individuals find it difficult to consistently track their diet and maintain balanced nutrition. Existing applications are often complex, paid, or overloaded with features. This project focuses on providing a simple, personal, and goal-oriented diet planning solution.

## Scope
The application is intended for a single authenticated user. It focuses on daily nutrition planning, food tracking, and progress analysis without multi-user or social features.

## Key Features
- User authentication and profile management  
- Automatic calculation of daily calorie and protein goals  
- Food database with nutritional information  
- Daily meal logging (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)  
- Real-time tracking of consumed and remaining nutrition  
- Smart food suggestions based on remaining targets  
- Daily and weekly nutrition analytics  

## Technical Focus
The project emphasizes backend development using RESTful APIs, object-oriented programming principles, clean layered architecture, and relational database design.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical application of system design and backend engineering concepts by combining nutrition-based business logic with clean software architecture.
